Installation Instructions
-------------------------------

ALiBERO is a Perl script and thus it does not require any prior "compilation". 
Anyhow, you will need to "install" it to make it work.

 1) Uncompress the script into your installation directory.
     Inside you will see several subdirectories (e.g., ALiBERO, MACROS, etc.),
     as well as a few files such as this README, 
     a LICENSE, the alibero exe and an installation bash script. 
     You should also have a PDF with a "hands-on" description.
     Change to this working directory after the unpacking is complete.

 2) Edit the file 'install.sh'; change the values for
     $alibero, $l_icm and $r_icm variables for your paths.

 3) Perform the installation by either executing "./install.sh" or "bash install.sh".
    Change the permissions so that the installation folder becomes 'rx'
    cd .. ; chmod -R 755 alibero_version_you_got/

 4) After the installation is complete, copy the folder "test" and all its contents 
     to a different location and perform a few runs in your Desktop machine. 
     You may need to change paths within the parameters file.
    
     To see ALiBERO manual type:
     $path_to_alibero/alibero -man
 
 5) If you plan to submit jobs to a PBS cluster then you must modify PBS.pm. 
    The idea is to re-create the scripts you use for submitting jobs inside PBS.pm. 
    It can be tricky if you're not familiar with Perl syntax.
    Before running ALiBERO you must able to connect passwordlessly to the cluster node that submits the jobs.
    * MakeDock.icm is the only icm script inside MACROS dir that will be executed remotely. Please
     change the 1st line so that it matches your icm path in the cluster

 6) VS are submitted via $ICMHOME/rundock using default parameters (i.e., -a). If you want to use a local 'rundock' script or different parameters then you must modify MakeDock/PBS.pm. Note that rundock by default uses icm 32 bit.

What is ALiBERO?            
---------------------------------------------------------------------
   ALiBERO is a new method that has automated all the steps of the LiBERO
framework. Starting from single or multiple receptor structures, the
software iteratively creates receptor ensembles, performs VS docking,
and selects the combination of pockets that maximizes the recognition
of ligand actives from decoys. The method was implemented as a free
add-on to the ICM software (Molsoft LLC).


What's new in ALiBERO 1.2-e3 ? 03-13-2016

  General Improvements

    o Changes in printed-to-screen lines.
    o Changes in default values for 'laziness' and 'function' parameters. 
    o Minor updates to improve performance.

Common errors: Symptoms and treatment
----------
    o line 1: 19468 Segmentation fault      (core dumped)
      diaghess_mrc_100_server &>/dev/null -> failed to execute: Illegal seek
      The NMA is capped at 2500 heavy-atoms (HA). If your system is larger you will see this error.
      Unless you have imperious reasons to include the whole protein I recommend trimming unnecessary residues. 
    o failed to execute: Inappropriate ioctl for device
      This error usually happens when ICM scripts can not be executed. Possibilities:
        - Very Common: ICMHOME is not well set and the script attempts to read files that were not created by ICM. 
          Make sure that ICMHOME is set in 'alibero' and in 1st line of MACROS/*.icm
        - Less common: Some files have lost the execution permissions. It can happen when moving between filesystems.
          Change the permissions so that the installation folder becomes 'rx' (chmod -R 755 $alibero/ ). Make sure that MACROS/Tether.icm is 'rx'
        - Rare yet tricky: The icm script is executed and works fine, yet it creates some sort of error to the shell and thus a != 0 signal. If this happens drop an email to the author.
    o ICM Tethering will NOT work properly with multi-chain objects. 
      Recomended: Please, join the peptidic chains in one ('mv a_1.A' will join all peptidic chains in a_1.) 
      This procedure will also work for other HET (e.g., co-factors, 'mv a_1.' will join all chains in a_1.)
      or
      Not Recomended: Modify Tether.icm so that it works with multichain objects (weird behaviour with 'minimze cartesian').
    o v1.ob is the only child selected when expecting many more. This is a symptom that Hitlist.icm is not working properly. 
        - Check that nligands includes enough actives + decoys (according to sdf indexing). 
        - Check that nligands <= total nligands in sdf file.
        - Check that the name of column for labelling actives / decoys is 'Active' (note the Upper case).
        - In cluster environments, if DOCK_1 fails then Hitlist.icm won't work.
        - Check if the best team of pockets displayed NSQ_AUC < 0 when using 'nsa' as fitness function. If so, please perform a pre-optimization.

Known issues
----------
    o sh in ubuntu is symbolically linked to dash shell and creates "Bad fd number" with system calls.
      To fix sudo rm /bin/sh ; sudo ln -s /bin/bash /bin/sh
    o Some Linux distributions do not include the standard Perl library Pod::Usage. Please, install it if needed.
